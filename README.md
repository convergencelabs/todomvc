# Convergence TodoMVC Demonstration App
This project implements the ubiquitous [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application in React. It uses [MobX](http://mobx.js.org) for the internal state store, and leverages [Convergence](https://convergence.io) to provide the storage backend and to facilitate realtime management of todos.  For good measure, this version of the application also supports dragging and dropping the todos to reorder them.
